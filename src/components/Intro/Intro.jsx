          Is a community driven NFT initiative that introduces the first of its
          kind jewish community on the blockchain. 100% of the profits from the
          project will be donated to top jewish charitable foundations. Weâ€™re
          developing new and innovative ways to give back to the community
          through Mitzvot (good deeds), Tzidaka (charity), and education.
          <br />
          <br />
          Project Six1Three has been built by a passionate and dedicated team of
          jews, non jews, and everything in between, all united by a common goal
          of doing good, and giving back.
